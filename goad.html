        <h3 class="conta">What is Gum diseases?</h3>
        <p class="conta1">Gum (periodontal) disease is an infection of the gums and can affect the bone structure that supports your teeth. In severe cases, it can make your teeth fall out. Smoking is an important cause of severe gum disease 
            Gum disease starts with bacteria (germs) on your teeth that get under your gums. If the germs stay on your teeth for too long, layers of plaque (film) and tartar (hardened plaque) develop. This buildup leads to early gum disease, called gingivitis.
            When gum disease gets worse, your gums can pull away from your teeth and form spaces that get infected. This is severe gum disease, also called periodontitis. The bone and tissue that hold your teeth in place can break down, and your teeth may loosen and need to be pulled out</p>
        <h3 class="conta2">How This is happen?</h3>
        <p class="conta2">Smoking weakens your body’s infection fighters (your immune system). This makes it harder to fight off a gum infection. Once you have gum damage, smoking also makes it harder for your gums to heal.
            <br>
            What does this mean for me if I am a smoker?
            <br>
            You have twice the risk for gum disease compared with a nonsmoker. 
            <br>
The more cigarettes you smoke, the greater your risk for gum disease.
<br>
The longer you smoke, the greater your risk for gum disease.
<br>
Treatments for gum disease may not work as well for people who smoke.
<br>
Tobacco use in any form—cigarettes, pipes, and smokeless (spit) tobacco—raises your risk for gum disease.
