        <h3 class="conta">Overview of smoking and Eyesight?</h3>
        <p class="conta1">Smoking is as bad for your eyes as it is for the rest of your body. If you smoke, you can develop serious eye conditions that can cause vision loss or blindness. Two of the greatest threats to your eyesight are: 
            <br>
            Macular degeneration
            <br>
            Cataracts</p>
        
        <h3 class="conta3"> Symptoms of eye disease?</h3>
        <p class="conta3">You may think your eyes are fine, but the only way to know for sure is by getting a full eye exam. AMD often has no early symptoms, so an eye exam is the best way to spot this eye disease early. An eye specialist will place special drops in your eyes to widen your pupils. This offers a better view of the back of your eye, where a thin layer of tissue (the retina) changes light into signals that go to the brain. The macula is a small part of the retina that you need for sharp, central vision.
            <br>
            When symptoms of Macular degeneration do occur, they can include:
            <br>
Blurred vision or a blurry spot in your central vision.
<br>
The need for more light to read or do other tasks.
<br>
Straight lines that look wavy.
<br>
Trouble recognizing faces.
<br>
        </p>
    
        <h3 class="conta5">Treate?</h3>
        <p class="conta5">If you smoke, stop. Quitting may lower your risk for both AMD and cataracts.
            <br>
            If you already have AMD, quitting smoking may slow the disease. AMD tends to get worse over time. Quitting smoking is something within your control that may help save your sight. Other healthy habits may also help protect your eyes from cataracts and AMD.
            <br>
            Exercise regularly.
            <br>
Maintain normal blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
<br>
Eat a healthy diet rich in green, leafy vegetables and fish.
<br>
Wear sunglasses and a hat with a brim to protect your eyes from sunlight.
