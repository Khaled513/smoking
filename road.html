        <h3 class="conta">What is Neck cancer?</h3>
        <p class="conta1">Head and neck cancers are the eighth most common group of cancers globally. These include cancers located in the nose, sinuses, mouth, throat, and voice box. There are different types of head and neck cancers. The most common is called squamous cell carcinoma.</p>
        <h3 class="conta2">How This is happen?</h3>
        <p class="conta2">Tobacco contains carcinogens. Carcinogens are substances that can cause cancer. Any form of tobacco use can increase the risk of developing head and neck cancer. This includes using smoked tobacco (eg, cigarettes, cigars, electronic cigarettes) and smokeless tobacco (eg, chewing tobacco, betel quid).
            For patients who have head and neck cancer, tobacco use negatively affects cancer treatment. Smoking is associated with slow or poor recovery after treatment. In addition, patients who continue to smoke are less likely to survive. Their cancers are also more likely to return. </p>
