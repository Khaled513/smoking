        <h3 class="conta">Whai is Heart Illness?</h3>
        <p class="conta1">Smoking causes structural changes in the heart and the blood it pumps to the body, impairing their ability to function normally. As a result, the risk of cardiovascular disease, including coronary heart disease and stroke, increases
            The disease seriously causes the disease and causes plaques that lead to coronary artery disease.
It lowers oxygen levels in the blood, forcing the heart to exert double effort to provide the body with the oxygen it needs.
It reduces the rate of blood flow to the body's organs, leading to injuries or thickening of the blood vessels and a weakening of the ability to contract and relax.
The blood pressure level reaches the heartbeat.
It increases blood viscosity and cholesterol levels, which increases the possibility of clot formation that may lead to strokes or heart attacks.
        </p>
        <h3 class="conta2">How This is happen?</h3>
        <p class="conta2">Cigarettes contain many toxic substances that harm the body even after quitting smoking. All of these substances are considered toxic with a devastating effect on the heart and blood vessels, in addition to their harm to other parts of the body. Some of the harmful substances used in cigarettes include the following: 
            <br> 1- Carbon monoxide: <br>Carbon monoxide gas prevents the blood from transporting oxygen effectively throughout the body, and this forces the heart to work harder than it should, to pump the largest possible amount of blood to compensate for the lack of oxygen. Carbon monoxide also prevents the lungs from working properly; This forces the body to breathe faster to deliver oxygen to parts of the body. <br>
            2- Tar: <br> Smokers' teeth and fingers are stained yellow-brown. However, its harm goes beyond this problem, which is considered minor when compared to the fact that tar causes cardiovascular diseases. <br>3- Nicotine: <br>It is an addictive compound found in traditional cigarettes and most e-cigarettes. Nicotine increases heart rate and increases blood pressure. If not treated appropriately, high blood pressure can increase the risk of serious health problems with the heart and arteries, such as heart attacks and heart failure. </p>
        <h3 class="conta3">Heart Illness types?</h3>
        <p class="conta3">1- Coronary heart disease: <br>Coronary heart disease develops, which is a heart disease that occurs when the arteries that transport blood to the heart muscle become narrow. Due to the accumulation of plaques or obstruction resulting from clots. Chemicals in cigarette smoke cause blood to condense and clot within the veins and arteries. The resulting blockage from a blood clot may lead to a heart attack and sudden death.
        <br> 2- Atherosclerosis: <br>Atherosclerosis occurs when the arteries narrow and become less elastic, due to the accumulation of fats, cholesterol and other substances in the blood, which leads to the formation of plaques that accumulate in the walls of the arteries. The internal opening of the arteries becomes narrower as these plaques accumulate. Therefore, blood cannot flow properly to multiple parts of the body. Smoking increases the risk of plaque formation in the blood vessels. <br>3- Peripheral arterial disease: <br> Peripheral arterial disease causes narrowing of the blood vessels in the extremities, such as the arms and legs. This results in reduced blood flow to them, which leads to a lack of oxygen supply to these organs.
        In the advanced stages of this disease, removal of the affected limb may become necessary in the event of an infection due to the difficulty of the healing process with limited blood flow. Smoking is one of the most common causes of peripheral arterial disease, but this problem can be avoided by stopping smoking. </p>
        <h3 class="conta4">Heart Illness symptoms?</h3>
        <p class="conta4">1-Shortness of breath, especially when doing physical effort. <br> 2-Increase in heart rate. <br>3- Chest pain, which also occurs when doing physical effort. <br> 4- Cough that may be accompanied by blood, especially in cases of mitral valve disease. </p>
